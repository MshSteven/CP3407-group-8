## Getting Started

Project goal:
The goal of this application is to provide a platform for students to rate the teaching of
professors in their courses and share their classroom experiences. Through this
platform, students can help other students make better choices in selecting courses
and professors.

The main features of this application include:

1. Providing a user-friendly interface for students to easily search and browse
evaluations of different courses and professors.                                        
2. Allowing students to rate and comment on courses and professors anonymously.
Supporting students in sharing their classroom experiences and perspectives to assist
other students in making informed choices.
3. Allow users to view detailed personal information of professors by keywords such as
school, major, and professor's name.
4. Allow users to view their rate and review history in their personal user profile and
access other users profile page to view their rate and review history.

We hope that this application will serve as a valuable tool for students in the course
selection process, helping them choose courses and professors that best fit their needs,
thereby enhancing their learning experience and academic performance.
